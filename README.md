OPTIMIZING CC's GROSS MARGIN AND REDUCING INVENTORY

CC's is a prominent clothing retailer with a vast presence across the United States, offering a diverse range of products in all of its stores. However, the management team is worried about certain stores that have lower gross margins and excessive clearance inventory.

The analysis was done on the actual provided data of 10 stores of CC. Prior to modelling detailed descriptive analysis was done. Further, clustering analysis was done to find the natural groups in the dataset followed by the logistic regression.

Descriptive analysis and modelling has been done using python.
There are four files of coding:
1.) Data Cleaning_EDA_Logistic_merged_data.ipynb
2.) Visualisation Code .ipynb
3.) Cluster_analysis.ipynb
4.) Visualisation Code .ipynb

Some of the Key Insights obtained from the analysis:
Inventory build for winter sale has higher chances of getting on clearance.
Special strategy required for stocking up cardigans and sweaters during winter.
Small Size(XS, XXS) is the major contributor for the products being put on sale.
Store 21 with highest gross margin and low product clearance sells 60% during summer and Fall.
Store 3 with least gross margin & high product clearance has highest percentage of XS, XXS size. Product Classes with Unit cost above USD 10.5 shows have higher chances of being put on clearance.
